Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.
Write a program using:
  - an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit.
  - The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze
  - turning right if it can
  - going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right
  - or turning left as a last resort
