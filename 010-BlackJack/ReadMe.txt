The Objective of Blackjack

    How To Beat the Dealer:

   - By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealerâ€™s hand value
   - By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
   - By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

    How Do you Lose to the Dealer:

   - Your hand value exceeds 21.
   - The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round

    How To Find a Hand's Total Value:

   - 2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
   - Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
   - Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.
