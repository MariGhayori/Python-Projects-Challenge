A first-price sealed-bid auction is a common type of auction. 
It is also known as blind auction. In this type of auction, all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. 
The highest bidder pays the price that was submitted. 

We want to write a program in which all the participants can enter their bid and we check to see who won the auction.
