Write a Program in which:
    . The user is inside an island and is going for treasure hunting.
    . There should be 3 levels:
        . Level 01: The Crossroad - with two choices
        . Level 02: The Lake - with 2 choices
        . Level 03: The Doors - with 3 choices
    . Remember that in each level there should be only one right choice and if user chooses the wrong one you should print "GAME OVER"
    -- You can get creative with the sentences in the game :)
