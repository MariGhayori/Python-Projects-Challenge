This is a number guessing game.

  - The computer will choose a random number
  - You get to choose if you want to play the game in hard or easy mode [hard mode will give you 5 guesses and the easy mode will give you 10 guesses]
  - when you guess a number, the program will tell you if you've guessed the number right or not.
  - if you haven't guessed the number right and you still have more guesses, it will help you with telling if you guessed higher or lower.
